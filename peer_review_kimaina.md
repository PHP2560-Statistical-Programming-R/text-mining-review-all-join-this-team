Comments for Team 2
===================

-   The graphs were really amazing: especially on the last question "Change of sentiments throughout the sections in all 5 books"
-   The analysis was really deep and straight to the point. I was able to understand not only by graph but also by supportive comments and background information
- I was also impressed by your code organization and eaze of access

#### Improve On:

-   Please add comments espcially in 03_clean_books.R, 04_get_sentiment.R, 05_graphs.R

Comments for Team 3
===================

-   Question and topic of analysis was really interesting with sufficient
    background information.
-   I was really amazed by the kind of creativity portrayed by different         group members in question 6: "How does the emotion “anticipation” change     throughout the book?" 
-   Graphs were really good: they clearly conveyed the topic of analysis well

#### Improve On:

-  Teamwork output - I couldn't find the final merged project of the entire team (I would love to see the final output merged from amazing work done by different group members)

Comments for Team 4
===================

-   I was amazed by graphs and analysis done on TedTaks. The group really did a great job in both the coding style and conveying their analysis using both graph and comments.  

- Graphs on  TedTalk analysis were amazing. Great job!

-   Analysis of TedTalk, Harry Potter and Trump Tweet demonstrated a high level of creativity.


#### Improve On:

- Improve on reproducable research workflow. Try to divide final_paper.Rmd into sub tasks. 500+ lines of codes calls for code refactoring



Comments for Team 5
===================

- I'm impressed by the amount of commentation done on the code especially olivia_analysis.R, linde_analysis.R, anna-analyzeData.R

- Brian did an extraordinary effort in his analysis and went beyond what was expected. At this level, using training sets and predictive model demonstrated a high level of creative thinking

- Amazing graphs created by anna, Great Job!



#### Improve On:

- Improve on code organization. It took me sometimes before understanding the flow and organization. 

- It would be really nice to merge the output of makefile.R and have one paper.html




Comments for Team 6
===================
- The topic was really interesting and objective of the analysis was well thought out.
- Graphs and visualization were great and properly answered the questions asked. Especially in thematic topic Modeling and most tweeted /favorited topic
- I was impressed by the way the group divided tasks. This is clearly visible in makeFile.R


#### Improve On:

- Separation of logic - Please try to wrap common functionalities into functions. I couldn't be able to locate some of main functionality e.g how you generated twitter data, cleaned it and wrangled it.
