### Team 4

Topic| Excellent| Satisfactory  |Needs work |
|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|Coding style| + Very well commented | | |
|Coding strategy| | 0 Nice use of loops in cleaning. But the rest of the code that is in the Rmd could have been factored into functions/ separate R scripts. |  |

|Presentation: tables | + | | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|+ So creative, especially with ggplot! |  | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| | | - Not clear where the final product is.. I used the TedTalks folder. Within that, there were no scripts for data analysis, as that was done in Rmd.|

### Team 5

This was my team.

### Team 6
Topic| Excellent| Satisfactory  |Needs work |
|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|Coding style| + Clear! | | |
|Coding strategy| | Pretty good but could have used data structures/functions in cleaning |  |
|Presentation: graphs | | 0 Graph was clear, but could have gone further with more specific graphs/colors! |  |
|Presentation: tables | + Easily understandable | | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|| 0 Great use of techniques but fairly limited quesiton | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| | 0 I think I missed the final product/ couldn't find it. So I only reviewed code in the "Lisha" directory. However, all of that ran well on my computer! | |
