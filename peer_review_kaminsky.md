- It was unclear to me which file I should run, I am basing my comments on the makefile and paper that were inside the
final_project folder
- Code seems to be well structured and well organized into many files that will make reproducing your work easy
- I really like the plots of positive and negative words by book and that you used 0 as the center of the plots so the
bars go in opposite directions but it is missing a title or explanation
- Overall, the plots could be formatted better so they fit on the screen, are easy to read, and have clear descriptions

- graphs were unique, visually appealing, and well presented
- the analysis and questions asked were detailed but the presentation was concise and easy to read
- some files are very well commented while others have little to no comments
- did not know which files should be run

- code is clearly organized in each individual folder, maybe consider putting all your work together into one final makefile and paper
- some of the plots do not fit well in the final paper
- code is easy to follow, but could use more comments on individual, unclear lines of code
- great approach and division of work

- consider combining work into one final paper, seems to be lots of extraneous files
- impressive use of statistical analysis to answer more complex questions
- quality of graphs varies among group members, some papers could use more graphs
- code is well organized and commented

- I only see a makefile in Lisha's folder, comments are based on that
- comments are useful, but sparse - more could be used to explain tricky individual lines of code
- not much data analysis
- only one plot and one table without color.
