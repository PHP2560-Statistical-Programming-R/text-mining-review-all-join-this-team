###Team 2

###Sadia
### 1.Coding style
Codes were properly commented. But the comments could be more specific;
### 2.Coding strategy
Although codes were seperated, but need to be further organized to make more readable. For example, in 05_graph_SS, different graphs can be listed by number or character.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)Graphs were labeled and each graph has its point;
(2)Figrue 4 has no line in it. Additional argument "group" may be needed for plotting line.
### 4.Presentation:Tables
(1)Tables can well answer the questions;
(2)One table is too large and it would be better to use plot in that question.
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
(1)In addition to ggplot2, also use wordcloud to plot;
(2)Extra efforts were put in making graphs.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work
(1)The makefile.R ran great;
(2)Work can easily access.

###Ze
### 1.Coding style

###Team 3
###Carol
### 1.Coding style
(1)Some codes can be put in different lines seperated by "%>%", which can be more readable;
(2)Codes are well-commented so that the purpose of each chunck can be recognized;
(3)The "beast" variable contains many words. Maybe the programmer can save the word in a text file and then read into R to make the code neater.

(4)Maybe some plots can be reduced or refined. For example, in question two, it's hard to distinguish each chapter just baesd on the color. The number of words displayed did not have to be that many.
### 4.Presentation:Tables
    No tables were displayed in this project.
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
(1)Extra efforts were made when making the plots;

###Maggie
### 1.Coding style
(1)The code style is overall desirable. Howevre, in the last two questions, codes could be seperated by "%>%";
(2)Comments were attached when necessary, but should be more specified so that each question can be easily distinguished.

###Weiqi
### 1.Coding style
    Comments should be added in some questions(like Q8);
### 2.Coding strategy
(1)Questions were saved in different files, which, maybe unnecessary, because some codes were quite short;
(2)Codes were overall concise.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)Graphs can answer the question;
(2)Graphs were well commented but in some sense little redundant.
### 4.Presentation:Tables 
(1)Two tables were made to answer the question;

### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
    Techniques and tools were well applied to the project.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work
(1)I can run the workflow.R. However, errors were reported that the package ggraph was not loaded, which should be revised in 01_get data.R.
(2)Actually, it would be more convenient if the source packages part was put in an individual file.
 
   
###Team 4
###Annie Yang
### 1.Coding style
(1)Although not commented line by line, codes were commented when necessary and were easy to understand;
(2)Codes was overall concise.
### 2.Coding strategy
(1)Questions were properly seperated in different file;
(2)Large questions were broken into parts to answer. For example, Q8.
(3)Codes contain no errors.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)The graphs were not saved through code;
(2)According to the final file, the graphs were well labeled and can answer the question.
### 4.Presentation:Tables 
(1)Several tables were displayed but written in rmd file. To better display the table, better use "knitr:kable". In this way, dataframe is not displayed in a "console form", and can set how many rows you want to display.
(2)All the table answer the corresponding questions.
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
     Other than teniques and tools taught in class, the programmer also used "wordcloud" and "biagram" to explor the text.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work
(1)Makefile.R run;
(2)Tables and graphs were displayed in rmd form. Graphs were fine, but tables were not that desirable. Better use "knitr:kable".
 
###Yiquan
### 1.Coding style
(1)There were some comments, but not enough. Comments can be written either line by line or in the beginning of each chunk to illustrate the purpose of the code. Comments would be easier to read if written in different lines when the code was too long.
(2)Questions were seperated from each other.
### 2.Coding strategy
     Code contains no errors and questions were analyzed seperately.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)No graph file was found;
(2)According to the html file, the graphs were labeled, but most graphs lack a title;
(3)The graphs could be further refined. For example, in Q12, the title of book was blocked by the graph frame.
### 4.Presentation:Tables
(1)The content of tables can well answer the questions;
(2)The tables were in "console form", which made it not good for exhibition. Better to "knitr:kable" to display the tables.
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
     In addition to the tools and techniques in class, the programmer also used "biagram" to explor the text.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work
(1)Makefile.R can be run.
(2)Tables would be easy to read if they were displayed through "knitr:kable".
   
###Ozan
### 1.Coding style
(1)Codes were well commented;
(2)No errors were found;
### 2.Coding strategy
(1)The codes wrriten in rmd were easy to understand; Howevre, if just read the Rfile, it's hard to find what questions the programmer asked;
(2)In the rmd file, questions were seperated in different chunks.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)Graphs were labeled and easy to read;
(2)Graphs can answer the corresponding question.
### 4.Presentation:Tables
No tables were displayed in this project.
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
Excellent plots. In addition to the teniques taught in class, programmer also used "wordcloud" to display the plots.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work
I cannot run makefile.R, mainly because the errors in rmd file. Errors were reported corresponding to line 106-131 and the last chunk(something wrong with plot codes). This should be improved.

###Fuyu
### 1.Coding style
(1)Some codes were commented, but more comments are needed.
(2)No errors were found.
### 2.Coding strategy
(1)In rmd file, the codes were seperated in chunks;
(2)It's hard to recognize what questions the programmer asked.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)Every graph has point;
(2)Graphs were labeled, but some may need to be refined further. For example, the x-axis of the first plot should have a title called "year".
### 4.Presentation:Tables
No tables were displayed in this project.
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
Besides ggplot, wordcloud was also used to visulize results.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work
(1)The makefile.R did run;
(2)The programmer chose to use rmd file to exhibit the project. This has some downsides. For example, Datacleaning codes were redundant when checking this project; Actually, all codes should be hidden and only results shoule be displayed.

###Team 5
### 1.Coding style
(1)There were some comments. However, more comments are needed for people to understand the code;
(2)No errors were found.
### 2.Coding strategy
The codes were well seperated other than put in a big chunk.
### 3.Presentation:Graphs
(1)Graphs were well labeled;
(2)Some graphs should be further retouched. For example, some words were blocked by the frame and the numbers in x-axis are too close to each other. Maybe the programmer should change the size of text.
### 4.Presentation:Tables
Tables should be displayed by "knitr:kable" other than the "console form".
### 5.Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity
Tools and techniques were well applied to the project.
### 6.Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work  
(1)The file organization was not so good. First of all, there should be a final rmd file to combine all the questions and results; Secondly, files would be easier to access if members have their own file; Thirdly, useless files should be deleted.
(2)The makefile.R can be run. But the project overall is hard to access because instead of one final html, this project contains several html files.

###Team 6
Several days ago I did see some files, but now it seems to be an empty folder.
