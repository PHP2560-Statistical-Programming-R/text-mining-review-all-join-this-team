# Dunkin Scrape

1. This file calls up numerous other R scripts in order to accomplish the task of knitting a paper. Each of these scripts does something unique and finally the last part of `makefile.R` is to knit the paper together. 

2. The final questions in html are selected and rearranged from the original test-mining weiqi.Rmd. The original file will be more like a draft. 

3. The final html is stored as edit_paper.html.
