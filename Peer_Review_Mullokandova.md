Comments for Team 1
===================

-   Team 1 had a very unique display of the graphs. Their question
    topics were creative. Overall, the presentation of their work
    was exceptional.
-   For Question 7 x-axis labels were too clustered to read legibly,
    possibly decreasing the font would help or creating a legend. For
    Question 8 the word network structure and pairs were hard to follow
    and obtain meaning form.
-   They incorporated a lot of comments in the code to follow along
    smoothly and it ran great.

Comments for Team 2
===================

-   Their topic was interesting with well-written
    background information.
-   Tables were well presented and arranged in order.
-   Wordcloud graph format was hard to follow - would prefer tables to
    represent the information more clearly.
-   There were too many unnecessary coding .R files - would be better to
    make more concise files combining them into tasks such as "get
    data", "clean data" "get graphs", etc.

Comments for Team 4
===================

-   Peer review was done specifically for TedTalks, since Team 4 split
    up into subgroups for the text analysis.
-   Very nice presentation with creative questions and display of graphs
    were intricate.
-   Graph types and aesthetics went well beyond course material to
    advanced levels of mastery.
-   A few more comments could be useful for the code, but it
    runs nicely.
-   There was no seperate R file for gathering data or graphs - it would
    be helpful to make a seperate R file for these tasks rather than
    running all the code into the .Rmd file.

Comments for Team 5
===================

-   For Team 5, there were not seperate folders for each individual.
    Instead, files for every team member was placed under the
    repository - would be better if every team member made a folder that
    organizes their files together. This just makes it easier to follow.
-   Olivia's paper was analyzed. The questions were confusing to follow,
    not really creative, and rather repetitive it seemed (i.e. a
    seperate question for analyzing positive sentiment and another
    question for negative sentiment, then a seperate question for the
    combination of the two).The idea as a whole of using the New York
    Times was interesting, but it would be good to come up with some
    unique questions of analysis.
-   Graphs were poorly labeled - there were some vague labels such as
    "False" and "True" - would be better to replace these graph titles
    with the actual title the graphs are portraying.

Comments for Team 6
===================

-   Lisha was the only member that had a folder that ran properly. There
    were neither other folders present nor does it appear that there
    were any R files present in their team's repository for
    other members. However, she was only responsible for doing one
    question it seemed.
-   The overall group final paper did not run properly due to no
    check\_packages.R to install packages that were missing.
-   Code has errors/typos even after installing packages that does not
    allow to run (ex: guines.td instead of guiness.td on line 83).
-   Could not view graphs other than Lisha's because of errors
    knitting document.
-   Comments were satisfactory but more comments could be used for
    complex lines that are hard to follow computations. The topic seems
    interesting if the work would have been completed.
