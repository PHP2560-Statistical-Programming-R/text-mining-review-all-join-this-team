## Background

TED Talks is a popular conference that coveres a broad range scientific, cultural, and academic topics. According to wikipedia, TED Talks lectures (which are free to watch online), have been streamed over a billion times. 

Using data obtained from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks), we can use the tidytext R package to perform sentiment analysis on the TED Talk transcripts. The data also contain 17 other variables such as time filmed, tags, ratings, and user views. 

### Question 1: Which talks had the highest proportion of positive words?


```{r}
transcripts_bing = sentiments_bing
transcripts_nrc = sentiments_nrc

transcripts_bing %>%
  filter(sentiment == "positive") %>%
  filter(wordcount > 510) %>%
  count(name, sentiment, wordcount) %>%
  mutate(positive_p = n / wordcount) %>%
  arrange(desc(positive_p)) %>%
  top_n(20)


```
Talk about finding a cutoff for wordcount.
