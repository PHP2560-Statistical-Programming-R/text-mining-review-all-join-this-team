Comments for Team 1
===================

-   Allen and Yimo's projects:
-   Graphs: Interesting presentations but lack
    explanation/interpretation from some of the group members.
-   Some of the graphs could be better presented, but adequately answers
    the question.
-   Good comment documentation and code structure.

Comments for Team 2
===================

-   Ze's project:
-   Interesting analyses and adequate explanations.
-   Some of the coding could have been replaced with functions rather
    than copy/paste multiple times.
-   Organized code structure.

Comments for Team 4
===================

-   Fuyu and Annie's project
-   Organized coding structure but need more comments to clarify
    functions used.
-   Good graphics but lack centralized location to display of all them
    at once.
-   There should be some explanation/interpretation for the graphs.
-   Very interesting topic and the mining technique is beyond
    the basics.

Comments for Team 5
===================

-   Anna's project:
-   The graphs could be more creatively presented, but
    adequate nonetheless.
-   Good explanations followed the graphs.
-   The topics questions are generic. Because the text project deals
    with the New York Times, tying current event keywords (e.g.: Trump,
    Clinton, Climate, etc.) would give some interesting
    graphical presentations.
-   Needs comments for documentation.

Comments for Team 6
===================

-   All members' projects (as there are no individual files):
-   No interpretation for the graphs; some of the graphs don't show up
    on the .Rmd file.
-   Data folder is empty.
-   Could use functions to run some of the codes so it would be easier
    to follow and condense the codes.
-   No individual folders, so all the files are clustered under 1 file.
    Hard to comb through the work.
-   Interesting topic but needs better execution.
