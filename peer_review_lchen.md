# Peer Review of Work
##### **Linde Chen**

It is crucial that you are able to review other code to assess the quality of the code as well as how you might be able to implement this code. 
We will practice this skill by making sure you review the code of others. Please remember the following rubric: 

## **Team 1**

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|--------|---|---|---|
|Coding style| | 0 Some but not all members included comments in code, but comments could be used more to help readers understand code. Also, indentation and line spacing would help with code presentation. In general a little bit heavy handed | |
|Coding strategy| + Good breakdown of steps| | |
|Presentation: graphs| + Notable effort in graphs presentation | | |
|Presentation: tables| | 0 | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity| | 0 | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| | 0 A little confusing to figure out whose files were where | |

## **Team 2**

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|--------|---|---|---|
|Coding style| | 0 Code heavy handed and blocky at times. Comments were used but were long at times | |
|Coding strategy| | 0 Good breakdown of steps | |
|Presentation: graphs| + Very nice graphs and tables in general - colourful, detailed and visually effective | | |
|Presentation: tables| + | | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity| | 0 | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| + Files laid out in a sequential and easily accesssible fashion | | |

## **Team 3**

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|--------|---|---|---|
|Coding style| | 0 Good in general. Comments are used where needed and generally easy to read | |
|Coding strategy| + Breaks down code into smaller parts. Code generally efficient | | |
|Presentation: graphs| + Very nice graphs and tables in general - colourful, detailed and visually effective | | |
|Presentation: tables| + | | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity| | 0 | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| + | | |

## **Team 4**

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|--------|---|---|---|
|Coding style| | 0 | |
|Coding strategy| | 0 | |
|Presentation: graphs| | 0 Presentation good, but sometimes not entirely clear why particular graphs were chosen to answer specific questions or to help visualize specific ideas | |
|Presentation: tables| + | | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity| | 0 | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| | 0 Sometimes unclear whose work was whose and where things are | |

## **Team 6**

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|--------|---|---|---|
|Coding style| | 0 Some code was displayed in final work | |
|Coding strategy| | 0 | |
|Presentation: graphs| | 0 Graphs were used but did not always enhanced comprehension | |
|Presentation: tables| | 0 | |
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity| | 0 | |
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| | 0 Sometimes difficult to figure out whose files are where. Many random files left in main repo | |
