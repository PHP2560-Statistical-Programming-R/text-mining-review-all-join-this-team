# Comments for the teams:

Team 1:
======
- Overall, good coding style and strategy
- Some of the graphs have too large axis lables/facet labels/tick marks
- Resizing the fonts in graphs would greatly improve these graphs

Team 3:
======
- They have well organized paper with nice graphs
- They also have the issue of too large font size in some graphs
- Codes are easier to follow and looks good

Team 4:
======
- They have excellent graphs with well-organized paper, especially on Ted Talk and Trump's Twitter 
- Although some codes are difficult to follow they have shown their mastery on the graphs and analytical skills

Team 5:
======
- At first their folder seemed to be disorganized containing too many files but when I finally ran the makefile it created all the papers at the same time.
- Organizing the files into subfolders or making a note about a single makefile would be nice
- They have clean concise papers with nice graphs

Team 6:
======
- I think some of the files/folders are miisng in Team 6
- I could only run the analysis of one person
- Coding style is good but there is too little analysis on the data. More exploration might have revealed interesting facts
