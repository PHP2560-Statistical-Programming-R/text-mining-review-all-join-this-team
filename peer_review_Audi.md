|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|#Coding style|| get_packages function did not work had to rename package_check function to make it work. Also had problem in SSL handshake probably due to the need of specific certificate to connect.
|Coding strategy|| had to see code in other subfolders because makefile.R did not work. but in general Complicated  problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array).|
|Presentation: graphs| graph are suitable and simple.
|Presentation: tables|| few tables used but generally appropriate.
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|| Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable.
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| ||code did not run. had to go into subfolders and cheack codes and could not import data from site due to handshake fail|
