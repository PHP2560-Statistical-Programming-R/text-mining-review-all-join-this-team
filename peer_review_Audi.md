###team 2 
Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|------| -------- |---------| ----------|
|Coding style|| get_packages function did not work had to rename package_check function to make it work. Also had problem in SSL handshake probably due to the need of specific certificate to connect.
|Coding strategy|| had to see code in other subfolders because makefile.R did not work. but in general Complicated  problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array).|
|Presentation: graphs| graph are suitable and simple.
|Presentation: tables|| few tables used but generally appropriate.
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|| Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable.
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work| ||code did not run. had to go into subfolders and cheack codes and could not import data from site due to handshake fail|

###team 3

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|------| -------- |---------| ----------|
|Coding style| every person in the team had his own project but in general the team has gone beyond what was expected and required, , code is well commented|
|Coding strategy| i could not make makefile.R work thre was no project file to open!. Bu after reading subfolders codes, Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array).|
|Presentation: graphs| graph are suitable, simple and creative.|
|Presentation: tables|| tables rarely used but generally appropriate.|
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|extra packeges were utilized in a creative way. code is simplified|
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work|| | code did not run had to open old files to read code.|

##team 4 

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|------| -------- |---------| ----------|
|Coding style|Amazing simple and creative coding style|
|Coding strategy| simplified with cmplex problems broken to pieces, creative use of functions.|
|Presentation: graphs| graph are suitable, simple and creative.|
|Presentation: tables|| fair tables that delever the intended information|
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity| organization and clear function names|
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work||| could not make the makefil.R work So, needed to cheack individual files to read code|
