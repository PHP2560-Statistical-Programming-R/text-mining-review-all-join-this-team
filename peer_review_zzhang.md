# Peer Review of Work by Ze Zhang

#Team1
- Alan: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But for Figure 7B, it seems that the left of the graph is truncated slightly. And for Q8, there are unreadable words in the title. The code runs well. 
- Nour: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But graphs are not organized well in the final presentation as there are no titles for graphs, and questions and graphs are separated which makes them hard to read. The code runs well. TT: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the question very well with annotations. The code runs well. 
- Yimo: Coding style and coding strategy are organized, but it would be better to have more comments on major steps. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But in the final presentation, codes are included which makes it look verbose and it would be better if some background information are presented. The code runs well.
- text-mining-Wei-Wang: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. In the final presentation, it would be better if some background information is presented. Code runs well.

#Team 3
- Carol: Coding style and coding strategy are organized, but it would be better to have more comments on major steps. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. Code runs well. 
- Carolina: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But in the final presentation, it seems that graph titles for Q3 and Q4 are truncated slightly, but it doesn’t influence graph reading. Code runs well.
- Isaac: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. Code runs well.
- Joyce Elias: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But in the final presentation, it seems that some words in graph Q5 and Q6 are hard to read. Code runs well.
- Julia: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But in the final presentation, code was shown for Q5 which you may don’t want. And I think the graph for Q5 is for each chapter rather than each book. The background info is somehow not shown. Code doesn’t run well because the file names used in code are inconsistent with real file names.
- Maggie: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. It would be better if some background info is included. Code runs well.
- Weiqi: Coding style and coding strategy are organized, but it would be better to have more comments on major steps. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. Code runs well.

#Team 4
- harry potter Annie Yang: Coding style and coding strategy are organized, but it would be better to have more comments on major steps. Graphs look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But the tables are not presented as adjusted table form, it’s better to use knitr::kable on tables for better presentation. And in the final presentation, codes are included which makes it look verbose and it would be better if some background information are presented. Code runs well.
- harry potter Yiquan: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But the tables are not presented as adjusted table form, it’s better to use knitr::kable on tables for better presentation. And in the final presentation, codes are included which makes it look verbose and it would be better if some background information are presented. Code runs well.
- TedTalks:  Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. Code runs well.
- TrumpTweets Donald Trump by Ozan: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized, codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs and table look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. Code runs well.
- TrumpTweets Ivanka Trump by Fuyu: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs look nice, creative, and they illustrate the questions very well. But the tables are not presented as adjusted table form, it’s better to use knitr::kable on tables for better presentation. And in the final presentation, codes are included which makes it look verbose. Code doesn’t run perfectly because file pathways used in code are not consistent.

#Team5
- Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are well commented and easy to read. Graphs look nice, and they illustrate the questions very well. But tables could be better presented by further adjustments. Code runs well.

#Team6
- Lisha: Coding style and coding strategy are clear and organized. Codes are commented to read. Graphs look nice, and they illustrate the questions very well. But the analysis is rather short. Code doesn’t run well because the file pathway is not well indicated.


#Summary
- Various types of graph that used by other groups impressed me as how delicate and illustrative they are. Learned a lot of different codes for different types of graph that would be useful for different questions asked. Also, some coding styles are worth knowing as they’re concise, clear and well-commented.
