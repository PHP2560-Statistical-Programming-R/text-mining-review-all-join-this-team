## Comments

### Team 1

Coding style: Code is well commented. Having Provided the background information of Harry Potter makes the code more human readable towards people who don't have a good knowledge of Harry Potter Series. When cleaning dataset, the codes show how to do it step by step, so that we know what information contained in the cleaned dataset. A function is written for data cleaning.

Coding strategy: Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. For each sub-problem, the code is readable with comments. However, for some questions, I cannot find obvious answer to it.

Presentation graphs: For some graphs, it would be better if some explanations can be given below the graph. Also, some labels can be added to the graphs.

Presentation tables: There are relatively few tables in the analysis. If possible, the team can provide some tables and make the comparison more understandable. For example, while showing the top ten words by word cloud graph, it may be better if there is a table to show the exact count of the top words. And some tables can be better structured.

Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity: Well applied the tools and techniques from the course. Some questions are creative, such as "Did sentiment differences from one book to the next affected sales/popularity?", analyzing the sentiment by book using different sentiment lexicon, "How does positive sentiment change over time. Does the author has a specific pattern of control of positive sentiment?". 

Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work: Easy to understand the code and most of the codes run. However, some files can be deleted and better organized.


### Team 2

Coding style: Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, code is well commented. The student has provided the background information of textual data and listed the questions at the begining, which makes the questions and answers more human readable. Howerver, for some parts of the code, it will be easier to read if the code (such as the code in 05_graph.R) is breaked into short line by line.

Coding strategy: Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. For the 04_get_sentiment and 05_graphs R files, it would be better if some comments are added. And there are some illustration helping reader to understand the graph. Code uses appropriate data structure.

Presentation graphs: Necessary lables have been added. And the different color in the wordcloud makes the comparison of words' frequency in each book more obvious.

Presentation tables: Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. For example, top 10 positive and negative words in each book are clearly showed by the tables.

Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity: Well applied the tools and techniques from the course.

Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work: Easy to understand the code and codes runs.

### Team 3

Coding style: Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, code is well commented. Questions are listed at the begining and background information of books is provided, which provide the readers a good overview what the code is going to solve. The code is written line by line briefly making it easier to read and understand.

Coding strategy: Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code uses appropriate data structure. For each sub-problem, the code is readable with comments. And there are some illustration helping readers to understand the graph. 

Presentation graphs: Necessary lables have been added. Use some excellent graph to visualize the data. For example, for Question : What are the most common words by chapter? The graph clearly shows the frequency of the common words in each chapter in Globlet Of Fire. The reference line is added and different smoothing methods are used. For some graphs, trendline is added, which makes the graph nicer and the comparison between negative and positive words is clear.

Presentation tables: There are relatively few tables in the analysis. If possible, the team can provide some tables and make the comparison more understandable.

Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity: Well applied the tools and techniques from the course. Some questions are creative, such as Question: How many beasts in the Fantastic Beasts book were mentioned in all the Harry Potter books? The team also talks about the shortcomings of the previous answer and try to give a more precise answer at the end.

Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work: Easy to understand the code and codes runs.
  
### Team 5

Coding style: Code is well commented. The code is written line by line briefly making it easier to read and understand.

Coding strategy: Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. For each sub-problem, the code is readable. For each sub-problem, the code is readable. And for each problem, you can find an answer or conclusion corresponding to it. At the beginning, the student presents the question and also at the end of the analysis, there is a conclusion, which make it more understandable to readers.

Presentation graphs: Necessary lables have been added. The graphs make it easy to compare the differene of negative or positive words between all-caps and all-caps headlines. And with the illustration below the graphs, the graphs become more understandable.

Presentation tables: There are relatively few tables. The team can provide some tables and make the comparison more understandable or stress some data in the table. (such as the red point scores and green point scores can be showed in a table)

Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity: Well applied the tools and techniques from the course. The student also used the Chi-squared test to compare the difference in proportion of negative sentiment words and showed a reasonable conclusion.

Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work: Easy to understand the code and codes runs. It would be better if the team can include each one's work in seperate folder.

### Team 6

Coding style: More comments can be added to the code.

Coding strategy: Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. For each sub-problem, the code is readable. For each sub-problem, the code can be more readable with more comments and some code can be written short in a line.

Presentation graphs: Necessary lables have been added. And explanation of the graph is given.

Presentation tables: For the table displaying the number of months each company has the highest retweets, it can be arranged by count. And there are relatively few tables. The team can provide some tables and make the comparison more understandable

Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity (0): Well applied the tools and techniques from the course. 

Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work: Easy to understand the code and codes runs.
