Text Analyis
================

Your mission
============

Perform text analysis.

Okay, I need more information
-----------------------------

Perform sentiment analysis or topic modeling using text analysis methods as demonstrated in the pre-class work and in the readings.

Okay, I need even more information.
-----------------------------------

Do the above. Can't think of a data source?

-   `gutenbergr`
-   `AssociatedPress` from the `topicmodels` package
-   `NYTimes` or `USCongress` from the `RTextTools` package
-   Harry Potter Complete 7 Books text \`\`\` if (packageVersion("devtools") &lt; 1.6) { install.packages("devtools") }

devtools::install\_github("bradleyboehmke/harrypotter") \`\``- [State of the Union speeches](https://pradeepadhokshaja.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/scraping-the-web-for-presdential-inaugural-addresses-using-rvest/) - Scrape tweets using [`twitteR\`\](<https://www.credera.com/blog/business-intelligence/twitter-analytics-using-r-part-1-extract-tweets/>)

Analyze the text for sentiment OR topic. **You do not need to do both**. The datacamp courses and [Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/) are good starting points for templates to perform this type of analysis, but feel free to *expand beyond these examples*.

Timelines and Task
==================

We will spend the next 2 weeks working on analyzing textual data in R. You will do the following:

-   Start with some text based data.
-   Clean data and prepare it for analysis
-   Ask questions about the data
-   Answer these questions with the data using tables and graphics
-   Each group member must have their own unique question that they code the answer for.
