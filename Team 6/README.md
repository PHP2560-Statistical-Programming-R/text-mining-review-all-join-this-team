# WheresIvyTextMining
TeamWheresIvyNewRepository

For this project we were interested in exploring twitter data on beer companies. Our inital thought was to look at twitter marketing aimed toward youth. With limited access to age data from twitter (a paid data source) we redefined our questions listed below.

#Process

We choose 5 brands of beer from different multinational companies around the world for our analysis.Budlight, Dos Equis, Guinness U.S., Blue Moon and Tsingtao. Each of us cleaned the data for our assigned beer companies and we merged our clean data. Our data wrangleing file was sent to you separately due to twitter authorization code privacy.

#Questions

1.Derek, Sentiment Analysis by day of the week, Does sentiment analysis change of the     course of the week by each beer company?
2.Michael, Thematic Topic Modeling, What are the most popular topics overall? 
3.Tess, What are the most popular topics on Saturdays across the 5 companies?
4 Lisha, Among the highest retweets each month, which are the most popular words?
5.David, What are the most frequently used words by each company?
