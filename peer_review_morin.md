Missing instructions and description in the README file. There are a lot
of files and folders in the directory. it wasn't obvious which ones to
run. I thought the graphs answered the questions but could use some
fine-tuning. Sometimes the facet wrapping makes them too small to see
clearly. I think maybe adding legends or more description would help.
Most of the code was commented well. It may be better to hide the code
in the final output. Not all of the makefiles run.

The directory is well organized, but is missing instructions in the
README file. The coding style and reproducibility is very good and most
of the code is well commented. I thought the questions were interesting
that the results were well exmplained. Some of the graphs are
sophisticated. The makefile code runs.

</tbody>

The directory is well organized. I was impressed with the commenting in
the code. I also thought that the questions were deep and well answered
by the graphs. A lot of the graphs are sophisticated and reflect a clear
offort for readability. The makefile code runs.

The directory has a lot of files, but is missing instructions. The
coding is well organized and divided into logical sections. Instead of
displaying the r tibble style output, it may be better to use a function
such as knitr to make nicer tables. Some of the graphs were very
aesthetically pleasing. Th only makefile I saw (for Brian's project)
runs.

The directory is well organized and it is clear which files to run. I
like that the make file knitted all the projects together. Some of the
graphs did not render in the html output. I thought the questions asked
were interesting and graphs, tables, and descriptions were excellent.
The code is well commented. The code runs.
