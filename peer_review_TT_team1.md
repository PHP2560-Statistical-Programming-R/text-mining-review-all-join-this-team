# Team 2

The code ran well and smoothly. Coding style is good but none of the code was commented.

Many codes could have been turned into functions to avoid repetition.

Coding strategy breaks up project into smaller parts, but the flow is a bit incoherent. 

None of the graphs were put in the data folder on Github so I could not see the graphs in the RMD file.

# Team 3

The code could run on my computer. However, more comments could be added to the code for easier understanding.

Coding strategy breaks up project into smaller parts. The flow is coherent.

The graph for Question 2 could be ranked from high to low (like they did in Question 3) for better illustration of the answer.

# Team 4

The code ran well. Coding style is good and well-commented. However toward the end of the chunks comments become scarce.

The plots are appropriate in answering the questions. Headings are well-labeled and description of the data is concise.


# Team 5

The code ran well. Coding style is efficient but comments are a bit lacking for me to properly understand.

Coding strategy breaks up project into smaller parts, but the flow is quite incoherent.  

The plots answer the questions. However, the tables look messy and and I recommend using the "tables" package to modify them.

# Team 6

I could not locate the makefile.R. The one in the "Lisha" folder only has 2 questions.

The code in "text-mining.MN.Rmd" ran well. However, comments are too sparse to fully understand.
