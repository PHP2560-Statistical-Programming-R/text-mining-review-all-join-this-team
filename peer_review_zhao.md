Comments for Team 1
===================

-   Overall, Team 1 had very unique and creative graphs. Presentation of
    work was exceptional.
-   Question 7 x-axis labels were too clustered to read legitably.
    Question 8 word network structure and pairs were hard to follow and
    obtain meaning form.
-   Lots of comments in code to follow along smoothly

Comments for Team 2
===================

-   Interesting topic with good background information.
-   Tables were well presented and arranged in order. +Wordcloud graph
    format was hard to follow - would rather prefer tables to represent
    the information more clearly.
-   There were too many unnecessary coding .R files - would prefer
    making more concise files combining files into tasks such as "get
    data", "clean data" "get graphs".

Comments for Team 4
===================

-   Peer review was done specifically for TedTalks.
-   Very nice presentation with creative questions and display.
-   Graph types and aesthetics went well beyond course material to
    advanced levels of mastery.
-   More comments are needed for the code.
-   No seperate r file for gathering data or graphs - would prefer
    making a seperate r file for these tasks rather than running all
    code into the .Rmd file.

Comments for Team 5
===================

-   Under team 5, there weren't seperate folders for each individual.
    Instead, files for every team member was messily placed - would be
    better if every team member made a folder that organizes their
    files together.
-   Olivia's paper was analyzed.
-   The questions were confusing to follow, nonunique, repetitive, and
    not very creative (i.e. a seperate question for analyzing positive
    sentiment and another question for negative sentiment, then a
    seperate question for the combination of the two).
-   Graphs were poorly labeled - The vague titles were "False" and
    "True" - would prefer replacing these graph titles with the actual
    title the graphs are portraying.

Comments for Team 6
===================

- Missing some graphs in html output for sentiment analysis
- Bargraphs of beer company top 5 tweets x axis hard to understand. 
  Would be better if a legend labeling topic #s was a part of the 
  graphs, or word labels placed directly on the axis with a coordinate flip.
- Word clouds to portray most frequent words are creative, 
  but would suggest a frequency bar graph to answer the questions instead for more detailed information.
- Comments were satisfactory but more comments could be used for complex lines that are hard to follow computations.
