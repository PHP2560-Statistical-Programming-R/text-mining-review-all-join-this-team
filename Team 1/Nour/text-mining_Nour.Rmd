questions for analysis: 
1. what is the most important charecter based on how much is whas mentioned ? 
2. what is the most scariest book based on sentiment analysis ?
3. what the top ten used words in exception to stop words ?
4. sentiments by books 
5. sentiment by popularity based on "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/aug/09/best-selling-books-all-time-fifty-shades-grey-compare" "
and the sixth question is unique for every student 



# Your mission


Perform text analysis.

## Okay, I need more information

Perform sentiment analysis or topic modeling using text analysis methods as demonstrated in the pre-class work and in the readings.

## Okay, I need even more information.

Do the above. Can't think of a data source?

- `gutenbergr`
- `AssociatedPress` from the `topicmodels` package
- `NYTimes` or `USCongress` from the `RTextTools` package
- Harry Potter Complete 7 Books text
```{r} 

    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
  install.packages("devtools")}


devtools::install_github("bradleyboehmke/harrypotter")
    ```
- [State of the Union speeches](https://pradeepadhokshaja.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/scraping-the-web-for-presdential-inaugural-addresses-using-rvest/)
- Scrape tweets using [`twitteR`](https://www.credera.com/blog/business-intelligence/twitter-analytics-using-r-part-1-extract-tweets/)

Analyze the text for sentiment OR topic. **You do not need to do both**. The datacamp courses and [Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/) are good starting points for templates to perform this type of analysis, but feel free to *expand beyond these examples*.

# Timelines and Task


We will spend the next 2 weeks working on analyzing textual data in R. You will do the following:

- Start with some text based data.
- Clean data and prepare it for analysis
- Ask questions about the data
- Answer these questions with the data using tables and graphics
- Each group member must have their own unique question that they code the answer for.

Q1 what is the most important charecters based on how much is whas mentioned assied from harry ? 
```{r}

inner_join( characters_listjoin, by = "word" ) %>%
count(Book, word,sort= TRUE) %>%
  top_n(50) %>%
  filter( word != "harry")%>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = word)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~Book) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() + # start with a minimal them and add what we need

# not that joining and counting was done using first name only wich is not accurate. due to inability to use full name because  full names not always mentiond. also family name cannot be used because it is shared between many characters.
